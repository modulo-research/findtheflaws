This dataset was compiled and released by Modulo Research. While Modulo
Research does not assert exclusive ownership over its contents, it offers this
work under the modified MIT License terms below.

To the extent permitted by law, Modulo Research does not assert exclusive
ownership over this dataset. However, Modulo Research retains sufficient rights
to publish and distribute this work under the terms described below, and to
require that any public redistribution comply with those terms.

Subject to the conditions below, permission is hereby granted, free of charge,
to any person obtaining a copy of this dataset and associated documentation or
code files (collectively, the "Work"), to deal in the Work without restriction,
including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to permit persons
to whom the Work is furnished to do so, provided that such actions comply with
the Public Redistribution Requirements described below.

Public Redistribution Requirements

Notwithstanding the permissions granted above, any public redistribution of
the dataset files provided under this license — such as hosting them on
publicly accessible websites, repositories, or file-sharing platforms — must
occur in password-protected archive formats (e.g., ZIP files). The password
may be made publicly available, including by publishing it in the README file
of the hosting repository or distribution page, or provided upon request. This
measure is intended to discourage unintentional inclusion of the dataset in
large-scale foundation model training corpora.

This requirement does not apply to private sharing or redistribution within
controlled-access environments, such as internal research groups, academic
collaborations, or private file transfers. Such private use and redistribution
remain fully permitted under the same terms as the present License, without
the Public Redistribution Requirements.
